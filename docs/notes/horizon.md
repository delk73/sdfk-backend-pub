## Synesthetic OS: A Real-Time Perceptual Engine

**Synesthetic OS is not a game engine; it's a real-time perception layer that translates complex data into intuitive, non-visual feedback.** Our system uses Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) as a foundational data structure to convert any information space—from a 2D map to abstract operational data—into a rich tapestry of audio and haptic sensations. This allows users to *feel* data, navigating complex environments and processes with a new, deeply grounded intuition.

The core of our system is built for **compositional power and elegant experimentation**. We provide simple, high-performance primitives that can be combined, blended, and animated to model not just static geometry but also dynamic physical phenomena like blast waves and acoustic propagation. This entire framework is designed for rapid, iterative discovery, empowering creators to find novel solutions through play and intuition.

Privacy and efficiency are fundamental. All critical processing happens on-device, with an iterative hardware path that starts in software (WASM) and scales to a custom, low-power SoC for unparalleled performance. User data never leaves the device unless they explicitly opt-in to a privacy-preserving collaborative network.

### ## The RuleBundle DSL: A Language for Perception

At the heart of the user experience is the **RuleBundle DSL**, a human-readable and AI-compatible language for automating the perceptual feedback loop. This powerful DSL allows users, developers, and even Large Language Models (LLMs) to define simple, event-driven rules that dynamically adapt the sensory output based on real-time data and user state.

* **Human-Centric & AI-Ready:** With a simple JSON structure and natural language-like rules (e.g., `when 'focus' < 0.3 for '2s', trigger 'haptic_warning'`), the DSL makes perceptual automation accessible to everyone. An LLM can translate a plain-English request like *"warn me when I lose focus"* into an executable rule instantly.
* **Behavior Bundles:** Rules are packaged into sharable **Behavior Bundles** that define discrete sets of adaptive mappings, cognitive-load guardrails, and accessibility features. These bundles allow for a marketplace of pre-trained stimulus libraries and community-created experiences.

### ## From Software to Silicon: An Iterative Hardware Vision

Synesthetic OS is designed to scale from day one. Our roadmap bridges the gap from highly accessible software prototypes to ultra-efficient custom hardware, ensuring the system remains responsive and low-power at every stage.

1.  **Software (WASM):** Initial prototypes, including a micro-scale Tsetlin Machine for on-device learning and the DSL executor, will run in any modern environment via WebAssembly.
2.  **FPGA Prototyping:** We will move core, latency-sensitive algorithms like SDF processing and tri-modal (audio-haptic-logic) sync to FPGAs (e.g., Xilinx Zynq-7000) to prove real-time performance.
3.  **The SmartKnob:** A high-fidelity hardware interface with a programmable haptic actuator and high-resolution encoder, providing a tangible connection to the system's data fields.
4.  **Custom SoC (The End Goal):** A future custom System-on-Chip with dedicated cores for SIMD-style SDF processing, haptics, and machine learning, designed to achieve a sub-2-millisecond feedback loop with minimal power consumption.

### ## Data, Privacy, and Intelligence

The system is designed to learn and improve without compromising user privacy.

* **On-Device Intelligence:** High-resolution telemetry from user interaction is used to train an on-device Tsetlin Machine, adapting the sensory mappings in real-time. A local vector database (VDB) enables powerful session navigation and context-aware assistance with a minimal memory footprint (~2.5 MB) and zero cloud dependency.
* **Privacy-First Collaboration:** Users can optionally "opt-in" to the Collaborate network. This allows them to fetch new Behavior Bundles from the community and contribute their own anonymized data, which is processed with differential privacy and blind-signed tokens to build better global models. **No PII or device IDs ever leave the device.**

### ## Next Milestones

1.  **Implement the RuleBundle DSL Parser & Executor.**
2.  Prototype the Micro-Tsetlin Machine in WASM for on-device learning.
3.  Build the initial hardware stub for the SmartKnob interface.
4.  Create a minimal FPGA demo to validate tri-modal synchronization latency.
